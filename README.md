Dr. Prismarine Bluefall#3305 brings to you...

##Project Prismarine!

An experimental bot meant for its lead developer to learn and improve at programming, with the aid of other developers.

## Running:
1. Create a `config.json` file in the project root directory
2. Add the key `token` with your bot token string
3. Add the key `owner` with your user ID integer
4. Run `core.py` and you should be golden!
