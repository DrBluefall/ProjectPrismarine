        - If a captain deletes their account:
            - If a co-captain is present, they are automatically made a captain.
            - If multiple team captains exist, then the most senior one will be selected (based on order of assignment).
            - Otherwise, if there is no co-captain, one player will be assigned captain at random.
    - Community Broadcasts
        - Set broadcast reception channel
        - Block broadcasts from specific authors (pr.blockauthor (any of the author's broadcast ids))
        - Broadcasters must be approved by R&D team before being allowed to broadcast messages
        - Store message IDs of broadcasts for 1st week of uptime
        - Allow authors to recall messages
        - Message previews
        - Rules for Broadcasting:
            - PG-13 Content Only (No swearing, No NSFW).
            - Any linked content/servers must also follow the above rule.
            - One broadcast per broadcaster every 3 days.
            - Any broadcast can be pulled down, and it's author's priledges revoked at any time, at the discretion of the R&D team.
            - Every broadcast is closed with a disclaimer stating that the R&D team is not affiliated with the content of the broadcast and that the broadcast should be reported using the following command: (i.e. pr.report (broadcast id))

    - Scrim System
        - Captain broadcasts a scrim request, request gets added to db
        - Other captains can see currently open scrim requests via a command, join w/ another
            - Captains notified if they recieve a request to join, can be accepted or declined
                - The notification will contain the the profile of the captain and their team.
            - If accepted, the status is changed, and both captains are sent invites to an auto-generated channel for the scrim
            - If declined, the sending Captain is notified and the process ends there
        - Scrims are hosted in a separate server, where channels are automatically made for captains.
            - Upon the captains joining their private channel, the bot automatically shares both their Switch FCs.
        - Once captains have left the server, or they decide to close the scrim, or after 5-10 min. of inactivity, the channel will be deleted. Captains can choose to stay in the server, but they won't be able to see anything (except maybe a rules channel.)
    
    - Future Ideas:
        - Competitive Testing Initiative (Automated League)
            - Ratings based on Glicko2 rating system
            - Seasons last ~3 months
            - Results of seasons auto-broadcasted (top 10)
            - Top 10 teams get a special color on their profile, auto add "Season 1 Top 10" to past tournaments
