# Prismarine bot
Its a bot that makes prismarine or something...


## Running:
1. Create a `config.json` file in the project root directory
1. Add the key `token` with your bot token string
1. Add the key `owner` with your user ID integer

## TODO:
### Top Priority:
- Create profile check function, apply to all relevant commands
- Fix load, unload, and reload commands so that they actually work

### Planned for the Future:
- Implement loadout System
    - Decide on a means of getting loadouts into the bot (loadout.ink, through discord, or standalone app)
    - Design a way of how that info is to be displayed (probably using PIL in some way)
